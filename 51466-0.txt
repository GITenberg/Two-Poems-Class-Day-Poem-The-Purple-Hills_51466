                           WILLIAMS COLLEGE
                                MCMXXI

Henry Rutgers Conger, Poet of the Class of Eighteen Ninety-Nine of
Williams College, died at his home in Fanwood, New Jersey, on Friday the
eighteenth of June, Nineteen Hundred and Twenty, while his Class was
holding its Reunion in Williamstown, Massachusetts.

These two poems, written by him while an undergraduate in Williams
College, are now printed by his Class as a loving tribute to his
memory.




             CLASS DAY POEM


             I

    _In the hush of the early summer,
      ’Neath the smile of the soft June sky,
    We, who have lived together,
      Gather to say good-by.
    And now, with our labor ended,
      And the hours we may linger few,
    We kneel for our mother’s blessing,
      As is our right to do._

    _Stately and tall is our mother,
      Tender and strong and wise;
    With the light of infinite knowledge
      In the depths of her steadfast eyes.
    And as we kneel before her,
      Her voice rings clear and slow,
    As she speaks the words of the blessing
      That she gives to her sons, ere they go._


             II

    “Sons of my four years’ nurture,
       Ye who have eaten my bread,
     Pause ere you take the journey
       Down the wide roads ahead!
     Listen! that I may tell you
       In simple speech and plain,
     How from the debt that ye owe me
       Ye may quit yourselves again!

     The wisdom of generations
       I have spread for your delight;
     And the truths that men have died for
       Ye may claim as your simple right.
     Heirs of the hoarding ages,
       How use ye your legacy?
     Masters of many talents
       Render account to me.


             III

    “Are ye puffed with the pride of learning?
      Are ye pleased with the praise of fools?
    Have your minds grown cramped and narrow
      With the lore that ye learned in schools?
    Has your knowledge made you slothful,
      And your culture made you vain,
    That ye think to gain without labor
      What another must toil to gain?

    Then are your years here wasted
      As pearls that are cast to swine!
    Then are ye servants of servants,
      And no true sons of mine!
    For they who began behind you
      Shall pass you in the race;
    And untaught men shall shame you
      In the open market-place!


             IV

    “From the quiet heart of the mountains
      Ye must take journey, down
    To the world, that is ever careless
      Of the skirts of a scholar’s gown.
    And the sheltered life of college
      Ye must leave behind you then,
    And bear your parts in the battle
      Where men fight hard with men.

    There there is naught to help you
      But your wit and strength of limb,
    There every man is your master
      Until you have mastered him.
    For a great law governs the fighting
      And all are ruled thereby--
    ‘He that is strong shall conquer!
      He that is weak must die!’


             V

    “Therefore, that ye may merit
      Men’s praise when your heads are gray,
    Cling to the good ye have gathered
      From my teaching that ends to-day.
    Ye have learned many true sayings
      And many wise maxims heard,
    For some ye know the reason,
      And for some ye must take my word.

    But, though ye forget the others,
      These two hold firm and clear:
    The first is--‘_He that would win must work_,’
      The second--‘_Thou shalt not fear!_’
    For the vices of a strong man
      Are pardoned in the end;
    But he that is born a coward
     Hath neither foe nor friend!


             VI

    “Be tender, and quick to pity
      At the sight of another’s wrong,
    Humble before a weaker,
      Cringing not to the strong.
    Paying each service twofold,
      Nor counting the debt clear then;
    Keeping your faith with women,
      Speaking the truth to men.


             VII

    “High in the purple mountains,
      Where the world’s strife cannot come,
    Ringed by the iron cordon
      Of the hills that guard my home,
    I gather my sons about me
      And teach them at my knee,
    And when they have learned their lesson,
      My sons go forth from me.

    Over the world they wander,
      In the sunshine and wind and storm,
    But I sit here in the quiet room
      And keep the hearthstone warm;
    Watching and listening and waiting
      For their footsteps at the door,
    Till one by one as the years go by
      My sons come home once more.

    Then I fling wide the portal
      And welcome them to the hall,
    With praise for the strong, and pity
      For the weak, and love for all.
    And the welcome that I give them
      Is reward for those that win;
    And they who are spent with fighting
      Find a new strength therein.

    And when they have told their stories,
      And rested a little space,
    They rise, and get them forth again
      Each man to his own place;
    To take the task that waits him,
      And labor to the end,
    That he may earn a living
      For wife and child and friend.

    Careless of sneers and frowning
      From curs that cringe and shirk,
    Asking no greater pleasure
      Than the sight of his finished work.


             VIII

    “Ye who to-day must follow
      Whither your fates shall lead,
    These are your elder brothers!
      Prove yourselves of the breed!
    See that ye count as shameful
      No work your hands can do;
    And when ye are spent, come back to me
      That I may comfort you.

    Now, through the open portal,
      Rise and go forth to-day!
    And a mother’s blessing go with you,
      To help you on your way.”

Williamstown, June 20, 1899.




      THE PURPLE HILLS

      Air--“Annie Lisle”


    Dying echoes fill the valley,
      Heralding the night,
    As we gather on the campus
      In the waning light.
    In the west the sunset’s crimson
      All the heaven fills,
    And its glory rims the edges
      Of our purple hills.

    Fast the length’ning shadows gather,
      Sunset dims to grey,
    And the calling winds of evening
      Through the branches play.
    With the far stars pale above them
      While day’s tumult stills,
    Watching us who know and love them,
      Stand the purple hills.

    Safe within our little valley
      From the outer strife,
    Are enshrined the happy mem’ries
      Of our college life.
    And when darker days have found us,
      ’Mid this old world’s ills;
    Still our hearts will turn with gladness
      To our purple hills.

Williamstown, 1898.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
